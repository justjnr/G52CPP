C++ Module Coursework

Tasked with creating a simple CLI word guessing game â€” a bit like Hangman. The program reads in a list of words from a file, selects a random word from the list and obfuscates the word with _ characters. A limited number of guesses are presented and typing in a character from the alphabet checks it against the word. If it is not in the word, the letter is struck off the alphabet shown to the user and can't be reused. Once the word is guessed or the user fails to guess the word, the program presents the actual word to them and asks them if they'd like to play again.
